The current mobile application for untappd.com means that you are looking at your mobile screen rather than being social because it requires that you type the name of the beer.
Starting with the idea, that the beer selection in a bar is relatively static, and most bars have limited selection of beers we could make a better user experience for users of untappd.com.

So our team made a HTML5 mobile app using jQuery and hosted it on Hammerkit. Using Hammerkit allowed us to concentrate on building the front-end.
